FUCKYWUCKIES:
	- weapon selection ui
		- menu board background img has preserve aspect ratio on, but that is purely visual, thus children objects aren't scaling w/ the image but with the recttrans
			- could do custom scripting for ui arrangement....sounds like a pain in the ass
			- could change the art so that the menu back isn't separate from the buttons...maybe no menu back?

ART NOTES:
	- kriegsman leg height standing=7, crouching=4
ANIMATION NOTES:
	ADDING NEW ONES:
		- Enemies
			- add animation event function calls
				- for death anim:
					- EndDeath should be called on the last non-transparent frame
					- Cleanup at very end
		- Krieger Weapons
			- set all (un)equip anims to proper FPS (20 as of 1/3)
			- set reload anims to proper FPS (11 as of 1/3)
	TRANSITIONS:
		- exit time is what %ofanimation that the transition can begin
		- transition duration units fixedduration=sec nonfixedduration=%ofanimation
		- animations where some frames are empty, use AlphaSource=None to include empty frames when slicing
